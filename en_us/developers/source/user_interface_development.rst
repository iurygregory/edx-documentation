Developing User Interfaces
##############################

This section provides information about developing user interfaces for edX
applications.

All new edX pages should be composed of elements and styling shown in the edX
pattern library. You can use JavaScript from the edX UI toolkit JavaScript
library to implement pages in a way that is consistent with edX user interface
architecture.

*****************************
Using the edX Pattern Library
*****************************

The edX user interface pattern library is a collection of web application
components and visual styles that you can use to develop user interfaces that
are consistent with the edX platform.

The edX pattern library is available at `http://ux.edx.org/`_
.

The edx-platform repository includes an `example web page that demonstrates
using the pattern library <https://github.com/edx/edx-
platform/blob/master/lms/templates/ux/reference/pattern-library-test.html>`_.
You can use the example page as a template for creating your own new pages.

.. _ui_toolkit:

************************

develop user interface functionality for the edX platform. The edX UI toolkit
is available from the `edx-ui-toolkit GitHub repository`_ . For more
